# Programming Language and version
I chose C# for my programming language because I knew I would need to know it for my upcoming internship and because of its similarities to java, and I used version 10.0.
## How it handles
### OOP
C# handles object oriented programming much in the same way that java does, classes contained in files that have constructors, methods, and attributes.
One thing I did find strange however was that you can put classes in files with names other than what the classname is. I struggle to see how that is a useful feature but it is a weird departure from Java.
### File Ingestion and other code things
File ingestion is much the same as java just with different names for things, it was relatively similar for most other features as well. A few changes I noticed was that in instead of doing 
for(Class c : List) you do foreach(Class c in List), as well as maps being used a bit differently while still serving the same purpose. Because of the similarities most other stuff worked much the same, and I didn't get a chance to 
check out unit testing.
### Libraries
The main thing I used from a library was regex which proved incredibly useful. Other than that I don't think I really used any and I don't even know if that counts.
